# WARSZATY_1TYDZIEN

Project "Sit on chair".
It is my first project during the CodersLabs course.
The main goal of this project is to create a website using HTML5, CSS and JS.
It also contains a calculator which shows price depend on chosen color, material or transport. 
Files and images which I used in this project come from CodersLab.
